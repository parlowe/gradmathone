# Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce: Modern Romance or Crafty Marketing Campaign

## Background and Motivation
On September 24th, 2023 Taylor Swift was spotted at Arrowhead stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. This was the first evidence to support relationship rumors between Taylor Swift and Chiefs Tight-End Travis Kelce since they met during her summer Eraâ€™s tour and began spending more time together. What followed was an internet storm of speculation. Swifties were turning to the NFL in droves, hoping to catch glimpses of Taylor Swift attending games. Commentators for the Chiefs began using quotes from Taylor Swift songs to describe the games, and stats have even been published to compare the performance of Kelce when Swift is and is not in attendance. 

But is this purported romance all that it is meant to be, or simply a shroud for a more sinister plot? There is ample research in the field of economics on the influence of popular culture on consumer behavior. We are all influenced to spend our money in the way that others are spending their money, from the clothes we decide to wear to the music we listen to. Studies have shown that popular culture influences our perceptions on fair price, and that this effect is compounded by social media [1] [2].

In this project I am asking the guiding question: Is the partnership between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce legitimate, or simply a ploy to increase relative interest in their respective brands and thereby increase influence on popular culture? If this were the case, both parties would effectively be molding popular culture to create economically favorable conditions for their brands. I aim to investigate this question in the following ways: 

Aim One: Investigate changes in relative interest for each entity before Swift appearance on 9/24
Aim Two: Use regression to predict relative interest for each entity 

This project is interesting to me because I was a fan of both Taylor Swift and the NFL (though admittedly not the Chiefs) prior to their intersection. I also think it is entertaining to question popular social narratives, and apply statistical reasoning to cultural phenomena.
